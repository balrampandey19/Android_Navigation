# Android Navigation Architecture Component

The Navigation Architecture Component helps you easily implement common, but complex navigation requirements, while also helping you visualize your app's navigation flow. The library provides a number of benefits, including:

* Handling fragment transactions
* Handling up and back correctly by default
* Provides defaults for animations and transitions
* Deep linking is a first class operation
* Navigation UI patterns like navigation drawers and bottom nav with little additional work
* Type safety when passing information while navigating
* Android Studio offers tooling for visualizing and editing the navigation flow of an app
